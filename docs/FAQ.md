## How does this compare to...?

### Terraform with `kubeadm` run in a `remote-exec`?

The `kubeadm` provider does some things for you:

* Automatic distribution of certificates among masters.

    With `kubeadm`, before adding a new master to the cluster you have to
    1) `ssh` to one of the master machines where certificates are found
    2) upload the certificates to the API server (with a key)
    3) create the new master before the key expires (usually one hour)
    You have to repeat the process if you try to add another master when
    the key has expired.
    
    But all of that is managed automatically by the `kubeadm` provider.
    You just increment the `count` of your masters and you are done.
     
* Automatic management of _tokens_.

    So if you want to add a new node to the cluster you don't have to
    worry about the token you created before, when you ran `kubeadm init`:
    the provider will automatically generate a new token when the old
    one has expired or has been removed.  

In addition, having `kubeadm` integrated in Terraform means you can use some
attributes generated by the provider in other parts of your code (ie, the
certificates), and in the other direction: you can inject in the `kubeadm`
configuration things that you created on other Terraform resources (ie, 
certificates, IPs, etc)
